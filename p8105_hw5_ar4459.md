## Problem 1

For this problem, we are interested in data gathered and made public by
*The Washington Post* on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities. The code
chunk below imports and cleans the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") 
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (8): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_sex, city, stat...
    ## dbl (4): reported_date, victim_age, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

The resulting dataframe has 52178 entries, on variables that include the
victim name, race, age, and sex; the date the homicide was reported; and
the location of the homicide. In cleaning, I created a `city_state`
variable that includes both city and state, and a `resolution` variable
to indicate whether the case was closed by arrest. I also excluded one
entry in Tulsa, AL, which is not a major US city and is most likely a
data entry error.

In the next code chunk, I group within cities and summarize to produce
the total number of homicides and the number that are solved.

``` r
city_homicide_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  select(city_state, disposition, resolution) %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"))
```

Focusing only on Baltimore, MD, I can use the `prop.test` and
`broom::tidy` functions to obtain an estimate and CI of the proportion
of unsolved homicides in that city. The table below shows those values.

``` r
bmore_test = 
  prop.test(
    x = filter(city_homicide_df, city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
    n = filter(city_homicide_df, city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) 

broom::tidy(bmore_test) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| estimate | statistic | p.value | parameter | conf.low | conf.high | method                                               | alternative |
|---------:|----------:|--------:|----------:|---------:|----------:|:-----------------------------------------------------|:------------|
|    0.646 |   239.011 |       0 |         1 |    0.628 |     0.663 | 1-sample proportions test with continuity correction | two.sided   |

Building on this code, I can use functions in the `purrr` package to
obtain estimates and CIs for the proportion of unsolved homicides in
each city in my dataset. The code below implements this analysis.

``` r
test_results = 
  city_homicide_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(hom_unsolved, hom_total, \(x, y) prop.test(x = x, n = y)),
    tidy_tests = map(prop_tests, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate))
```

Finally, I make a plot showing the estimate (and CI) of the proportion
of unsolved homicides in each city.

``` r
test_results %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

This figure suggests a very wide range in the rate at which homicides
are solved – Chicago is noticeably high and, given the narrowness of the
CI, likely is the location of many homicides.
